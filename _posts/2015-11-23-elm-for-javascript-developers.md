title: Elm for JavaScript Developers
intro: In this post we'll explore Elm, a new programming language aimed at frontend developers.
---

If you follow me on GitHub or Twitter you'll have noticed that I've been doing a lot of work with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) recently. Elm is a new language aimed at making it easier to build more robust, complex applications. It compiles to JavaScript but shares very little in common with the language, and its syntax will look familiar to anyone who's worked with Haskell. In the first of many posts about Elm, I'll talk through some of the major features of the language and why you should consider giving it a try. Don't be put off by its different syntax; once you get used to it you'll realiise that it's a pleasure to work with.

## Immutablility and Pure Functions

Every single piece of data you have in your Elm application is immutable. This means that it can never be modified, and will always be set to the value it was given when it was created. What this means in practice is that code is much easier to follow, because you know it hasn't changed. As an example, think about the below JavaScript code:

```js
var person = { name: 'Jack' };
doSomethingWith(person);
console.log(person);
```

Without executing that code, are you able to make any guarantees about the value of `person` once `doSomethingWith` has run? Because objects in JavaScript are mutable, you can't. `doSomethingWith` could have done anything to `person`. In a larger application where objects are frequently passed through functions bugs are often caused by this. Functions that modify the state of the world, by mutating variables given to it, or that are globally available, are functions with __side effects__. Functions like this are difficult to debug and hard to work with. 

In Elm, every function is __pure__. This means two things:

- Given an input X, it will always result in output Y. If you give a function the same value, it will always produce the same result.
- The function has no side effects, and does not mutate anything or change the state of the world around it.

It's of course possible to create functions like this in JavaScript, and you can make it a rule in your application that functions should be pure. Elm enforces it due to its immutable nature, and this means it's impossible for impure functions to sneak into your code base, either through code you write or through code in a 3rd party library you're using.

## Types

Elm is a statically typed language. This might sound off putting, but it actually leads to far more robust applications. In Elm every value has a type.

```elm
"Hello World" - String Type
True - Boolean type
3 - number type
3.14 - Float type
[1, 2, 3] - List number type
```

You might think this is similar to JavaScript, and you'd be right. In JavaScript (and every other programming language), values have a particular type. The crucial difference comes when we pair this type system with functions. In JavaScript you might have a function that can take multiple types, and return multiple types:

```js
someMadeUpFn('Foo') => 5
someMadeUpFn(5) => 'Foo'
someMadeUpFn({ name: 'Jack' }) => { name: 'jack' }
```

There's no restriction on the types of the arguments that `someMadeUpFn` takes, and there's no restrictions on the type of the value it returns either. In Elm we have to explicitly declare all the types (actually, we could leave it up to the compiler to infer the types, but it's best practicse to declare them). The below code creates a function `square` that takes an integer and returns another.

```elm
square : Int -> Int
square x = x * x
```

If I were to write the same function in JavaScript, I'd write:

```js
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
```

Notice the first line of our Elm function:

```elm
square : Int -> Int
```

This is a __type annotation__ that tells Elm that this function will take one argument which will be an integer, and return a value that's also an integer. That means if we try to call this function with a different data type, we'll get an error. Although this restriction can take some time to adjust to, it actually leads to much cleaner code that's easier to work with and follow. It also means you realise straight away if you're using a function incorrectly.

## Compiling

Above we discussed how if you try to call a function with the wrong type, you'll get an error. It's better than that though, because you'll get these errors at __compile time__. Elm as a language compiles to JavaScript, and we need to run the compiler to generate JavaScript from our Elm code. Elm's compiler is smart, and is able to check the types of values when it compiles our code into JavaScript. For example, if I take this Elm code and try to compile it, we'll get an error. Don't worry about the specifics of the syntax, but know that this code will call the `square` function with the argument `"Hello"`.

```elm
square : Int -> Int
square x = x * x

main =
  square "Hello"
```

Here's what the compiler gives me:

```

The argument to function `square` is causing a mismatch.

5â”‚   square "Hello"
            ^^^^^^^
Function `square` is expecting the argument to be:

    Int

But it is:

    String
```

How great is that?! The compiler detected our mistake, and rather than getting an odd error when we run the code in the browser, we instead see a much nicer error telling us of our mistake ahead of time.
