title: Authoring and publishing JavaScript modules with Flow
intro: Today we'll see how we can author and publish JS packages with Flow, adding types to our JavaScript in order to have more confidence in our code and improve the development experience. We'll also see how we can publish types so developers using our code can benefit from the fact that it's typed.

[Flow](https://flowtype.org/) is a static type checker for JavaScript which adds the ability to annotate our JavaScript code with extra information on what types we're expecting values to be, what types functions can return, and so on. Having done a lot of work in [Elm](elm-lang.org), a language that is typed, I began to recently explore the popular options for adding types to JavaScript. Along with Flow there is also [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which is very popular and used extensively in the Angular 2 community.

I started with Flow primarily because it's used a lot in the React community (unsurprising given Flow is a Facebook project) and it has built in knowledge of React and its types. Although we won't use Flow with React today, it's easy to do so and I'm sure that I'll cover it in a future blog post. This post _is not_ me stating that I have a strong preference for Flow over TypeScript, or a post claiming Flow is better. I am just sharing my experience with Flow - so far it's been a very positive one.

## Writing Typed JavaScript

To start with I needed an example project to work with; I picked [util-fns](https://github.com/jackfranklin/util-fns). `util-fns` is a small project I started working on that contains a bunch of tiny utility functions (much like Lodash or Underscore, but much smaller and less optimised!). It's primarily a dummy project for the sake of learning Flow and experimenting. I also chose this because it's a module that I have published to npm, and as such could explore how to publish the module in such a way that the types are not lost. This means any developers who run `npm install util-fns` can access the type information.

To get started with Flow, I first installed it as a local dependency. You need the `flow-bin` package from npm:

```
npm install --save-dev flow-bin
```

You could install this globally, but I like to have all project dependencies installed locally. This also covers you in the circumstance that you have different projects that want to use different versions of Flow.

You then need to run `./node_modules/.bin/flow init`.

__Note:__ I have the `./node_modules/.bin` directory on my `$PATH`, [which you can find in my dotfiles](https://github.com/jackfranklin/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/zshrc#L101). This is _slightly_ risky, as I could accidentally run any executable that's in that directory, but I'm willing to take that risk because I know what's installed locally and it saves a lot of typing!

By running `flow init` you'll create a `.flowconfig` file which will look like so:

```
[ignore]

[include]

[libs]

[options]
```

Don't worry about the slightly odd syntax here, or the fact that it's largely empty. That config is more than enough for now - I've yet to really have to edit a Flow config - but if you need to there is [extensive documentation on configuring Flow](https://flowtype.org/docs/advanced-configuration.html) on the Flow site.

By creating this file we're now able to run Flow and have it check our code. You can run `flow` now to see what happens!

```
Launching Flow server for /Users/jackfranklin/git/flow-test
Spawned flow server (pid=30624)
Logs will go to /private/tmp/flow/zSUserszSjackfranklinzSgitzSflow-test.log
No errors!
```

The first thing you'll see is that Flow launches a server. This server runs in the background and allows you to incrementally check Flow code as you work. By running on a server, Flow can cache the state of your files and only recheck them when the contents change. This makes it really quick to run Flow on files as you're working. For times when you do want to just check your entire project you can run `flow check`, but in development you should always just run `flow`. This will connect to the Flow server (or start one if there isn't one running) and be much more efficient about checking only the files that have changed.
